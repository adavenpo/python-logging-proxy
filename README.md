# Logging HTTP Proxy

*** Derrived from @willthames's project, this handles some error conditions,
*** multithreads, and logs to a file (proxy.log).

Proxy that logs full HTTP request and response. Obviously things
like Fiddler etc exist and are very good, but this is really for
seeing what's going wrong when making API calls from a client.

To use, run `./proxy.py` (takes an optional port argument).

From the client side, set the proxy using 
`export HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8000/`
(assuming default port). 

Or just do:

```
HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8000/ curl -v http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/
```

You'll get something like this:

```
*** REQUEST ***
GET http://bot.whatismyipaddress.com/
Host = bot.whatismyipaddress.com
Proxy-Connection = Keep-Alive
Accept = */*
User-Agent = curl/7.30.0
